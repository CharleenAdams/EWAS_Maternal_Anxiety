# Results for the ALSPAC EWAS of Maternal Anxiety on Infant Methylation

This file contains the results for the full model, containing all covariates:

Methylation ~ maternal general anxiety (continuous) + child gender + maternal socioeconomic class + maternal age + ancestry + batch co$

About what went into the model:
--Continuous variables were winsorized for variables for which there were outliers (outliers were set to the value for 3SDs from the m$
--Maternal anxiety was derived from questionnaire items, and score was created that summed the number of items for which anxiety was i$
--Level of maternal education was used to captureÂ  socioeconomic status.
--Birthweight was measured in grams.
--Maternal smoking is a 3-level variable (0=no smoking; 1=smoked during 1st trimester; 2=smoked throughout duration of pregnancy).
--Ancestry was accounted for with 10 principal components dervived from GWAS data.
--Batch confounders were dealt with by using the SVA approach.
--The Andrews and Bakulski approach was used for estimating the cell counts in cord blood.
--The variable for psychiatric medication was derived from questionnaire data for use of anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications$
There were 634 mother-child pairs in the analysis.
Using the SVA p-values, there were 5 CpG sites with association p-values < 3.1096172 x 10-5 in the sva regression model.
This is a work-in-progress. . .
More models will be run.
